# Geyser Data Analysis

This project analyzes data from GeyserTimes.org for the Beehive and Old Faithful geysers. It consists of two scripts, Beehive.py and OldFaithfulProcessing.py that process the raw data and input them into spreadsheets.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Numpy Library
- Pandas Library

# Execution
To process the data, data from the Geysertimes format must be provided in the form of 3 tsv files, "Old_Faithful_eruptions.tsv",  "Beehive_eruptions.tsv", and "Beehives_Indicator_eruptions.tsv", representing the Old Faithful eruption times, the Beehive main geyser eruption time, and the Beehive Indicator eruption times respectively. 
Executing the scripts results in 3 excel files being generated, with the processed data.
